Graph analytics tasks, including pattern matching and graph algorithms, can generate large read-write operations that impact signi!cant portions of data, which makes their execution challenging under strict isolation guarantees. Consequently, we face an apparent trade-off between ensuring high isolation and achieving high performance, forcing users to choose between the two. In this work, we present TuskFlow, an experimental graph database based on Neo4j, designed to e#ciently handle mammoth transactions on graphs (the technique is applicable to other models such as relational) while maintaining existing transactional semantics. TuskFlow employs a deterministic protocol that safely reorders regular transactions around mammoths within an epoch. Our protocol supports parallel mammoth execution inspired by graph-parallel algorithms. To minimize con$icts with regular transactions, TuskFlow introduces query- and workload-aware optimizations, including graph entity tagging and partitioning. Our experiments demonstrate that, unlike traditional protocols like two-phase locking or MVCC, TuskFlow avoids blocking write transactions and improves tail latency by up to 45x.","tags":[],"title":"TuskFlow: An Efficient Graph Database for Long-Running Transactions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ye Liu","Paul Ezhilchelvan","Yingming Wang","Jim Webber"],"categories":["Replication","Ordering","Distributed Systems","Ring Networks"],"content":"","date":1752504300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1752504300,"objectID":"97269042a1c745784022eaaf3ca10855","permalink":"https://jimwebber.org/publication/2025-ideas/","publishdate":"2025-07-14T01:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2025-ideas/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a database replication architecture that guarantees ACID transaction properties as well as high throughput expected of modern database systems.

In this post I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about my experience of installing and using batteries, smart chargers, and time-of-use electricity tariffs. Specifically:\nMyEnergi Zappi chargers Octopus Energy Intelligent Octopus Go tariff Tesla Powerwall 2 Back in 2020 when I wrote about installing my first smart charger, my situation was pretty straightforward, though not very optimised. I owned (and still own) a BMW i3 which can be charged using excess solar via the Zappi charger as well as power drawn from the grid. The downsides of this setup are that the i3 has a small battery (~20kWh) and sometimes the car is elsewhere which both limit my capacity for absorbing excess solar. So often when the sun is bright, power is \u0026ldquo;lost\u0026rdquo; to grid.\nTo be plain, I like the grid. The grid is a public good, and my excess generation displaces otherwise more polluting ways of producing power. What I am less fond of is the lack of net metering which means I buy power at roughly 4x more than I sell it, which feels like a bit of a rip off.\nReplacing our Combustion Engine Car with a Second EV Though we owned an electric vehicle (BMW i3) which was our daily workhorse, we also retained our elderly Toyota Prius for long journeys. We had thought that eventually the next stage of the process would be to buy an EV with a large battery to replace the Prius eventually, but those of you living in the UK will recall that in 2021 the nation ran out of petrol. There were queues for fuel all round the country and that triggered us to replace our Prius with a Tesla Model 3 on the basis that we can make our own electricity, but not our own petrol!\nFor the avoidance of smugness, even though we no longer needed to queue for petrol, we still got caught in all the madness because the queues for the petrol stations were so long that they congested all the roads anyway! Such is life.\nWith two EVs we needed to charge them both conveniently. I added a Zappi charger in the driveway to complement the existing one in the garage. The two chargers are paired wirelessly, and they share solar generation and grid use so that any excess power can be siphoned to either of the vehicles (and respect grid import limits too). From the point of view of using local generation, this is much better than with a single car, since there\u0026rsquo;s often at least one car plugged in (cars spend a lot of their time parked at home!). In addition, the Model 3 has a ~75kWh battery its can soak up several days\u0026rsquo; worth of excess solar if left connected.\nBut then geopolitics happened. With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, methane (so-called natural gas) prices skyrocketed. Since the previous UK government took the unwise intellectual shortcut of pricing electricity as a function of gas, the price of electricity in the UK also skyrocketed (300% in my case). This is particularly egregious since the grid in Great Britain is increasingly less reliant on gas and more on renewables. Although 50.9% of UK electricity was from renewables in the first quarter of 2024, a kilowatt-hour of electricity for domestic use tripled in price with the onset of war, and has roughly remained at that level to-date.\nInstalling Tesla Powerwall 2 Units Even with solar generation my electricity bill is stratospheric, so this year I did the sums and decided to do something about it. My approach was twofold, to install batteries and move to a time of use tariff so that I could significantly lower my electricity bill. I chose the Intelligent Octopus Go tariff which currently provides 6 hours of electricity between 11:30pm and 5:30am at £0.07 and £0.24 otherwise. Since we use around 1MWh per month for home and cars, and I get around 5MWh from solar generation annually, I could potenally buy 7MWh anually at off-peak prices by time-shifting with batteries. This is an annual saving of around £1200 some of which I reasoned could be used to by the necessary battery infrastructure.\nNote: the unit cost of electricity figures apply at time of writing (and were slightly higher at £0.075 and £0.28 when I first installed the system), but volatility in the energy markets and change of seasons will change the absolute numbers. The point remains, however: off-peak electricity is very cheap now and will be for the forseeable future.\nI chose the Tesla Powerwall 2 for my battery needs and have installed two units with 26kWh of usable power. The arithmetic is pretty simple: the Powerwall units should last for 20+ years (guaranteed for only 10 however) and at a fully installed cost of just shy of £13,000 they will pay for themselves in under 11 years, leaving 9+ years as \u0026ldquo;profit.\u0026rdquo; This isn\u0026rsquo;t something I could fund out of my pocket, but fortunately the Nationwide Building Society currently offer 0% loans to their mortgage customers to retrofit their homes with energy improvements. Win!\nNote: I intend to add a third Powerwall 2 to the system shortly up to the maximum permitted capacity of three units on a single phase (my house has a single phase 100A supply). This will support time-shifted energy needs of a heat pump to be installed in the future.\nThe choice of a Powerwall 2 was deliberate. While Powerwall 3 had come to the market in my purchasing window, I won\u0026rsquo;t benefit from its integrated inverter (despite the lower energy losses of DC-DC storage). All my solar panels have microinverters, and so there is no high voltage DC in my system, just line voltage AC (230v). As such, AC coupled batteries are fine for me. They also have a good physical footprint, lying flat along the garage wall.\n2x Tesla Powerwall 2 units and the gateway fit well in the available space in my garage, leaving just enough space for a third unit on the left. I chose Spirit Energy to perform the installation. They were cost-effective and felt to me like they knew what they were doing, with both the Tesla system and the existing MyEnergi equipment. The installation took two days, not so much because of the batteries themselves which were installed very quickly, but because of some remedial wiring work to move my two EV chargers from the regular house circuits (which the Powerwalls will keep live even in the event of a power cut) to non-backed up circuits. This means the cars won\u0026rsquo;t charge in a powercut, but the house will keep running a lot longer because of it.\nEverything went pretty well with the installation. Various additional current clamps were mounted and wired into their respective systems (both the Tesla and the MyEnergi kit). The Tesla equipment came online seamlessly and took stock of the situation straight away. The MyEnergi kit was more fiddly - the in-house equipment acknowledged the presence of an AC battery, but it would not appear on the MyEnergi app as it should. It took a factory reset of all the MyEnergi equipment to solve that issue. Annoying, but I\u0026rsquo;ve done it a lot over the last few months (after a recent firmware upgrade noticably reduced stability) so at least now it\u0026rsquo;s a 10 minute job rather than an hour of scrolling through LCD scren menus.\nNow both Tesla and MyEnergi apps work, and I get slightly different views of current and historical data from each. The MyEnergi app is better at telling me about EV charging (which Tesla thinks is the house drawing lots of power), whereas the Tesla app is good at battery charging (while MyEnergi does not store historical data for 3rd party batteries).\nChanging to Intelligent Octopus Go and Smart Meters At this point, I was all set to change my grid connection too. After having my old analogue meters swapped out for smart meters (reluctantly, I have to say, because of lingering dependability concerns), and waiting a couple of days for the computers to catch up, I was able to sign up for a variable rate tariff.\nTo sign up for the Intelligent Octopus Go tariff, you have to hand over some control of your equipment to Octopus. You can cede control of a car, home battery, or car charger socket and while Octopus retain access to that equipment, you stay on the tariff. This currently gives you 6 hours of off peak charging every night, plus whenever electricity is abundant (which usually means windy here in the UK) they\u0026rsquo;ll give you off peak prices then aswell, and turn on your equipment to make use of it. But here\u0026rsquo;s where I learned that being close to the bleeding edge needs a bit of patience.\nUsing the Octopus app, I tried to grant Octopus permission to control my Zappi chargers. This repeatedly failed. I gave up, and tried to grant permission to my Model 3 instead which also failed, from Octopus\u0026rsquo;s side but not from Tesla\u0026rsquo;s (how I hate partial failures). I didn\u0026rsquo;t try integrating with the Powerwalls because I felt I was already in a mess.\nWith low expectations, I called Octopus support. I explained my situation and the support staff responded that they hadn\u0026rsquo;t encountered this before, but that if I would hold, then they\u0026rsquo;d find out more. My expectations remained low. A few minutes later, they came back to me and told me the problem: they don\u0026rsquo;t support more than one Zappi charger per property but if I temporarily deleted one of the chargers from my MyEnergi account then it would all work, and they said they\u0026rsquo;d email me instructions.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t a solution for everyone, but I was game. The email arrived moments later and off I went deleting records from my MyEnergi account. On the next attempt I was able to grant permissions for Octopus to control my \u0026ldquo;only\u0026rdquo; Zappi charger and soon after my Octopus app told me that I had transferred to the new tariff. Kudos to the Octopus support folks!\nThen it was a matter of reinstating my other charger into my system. Octopus told me they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to do smart things with that charger, but it would still benefit from it being cheap to run during the night time and still take advantage of excess solar. This is fine with me. I reinstated the charger, but the MyEnergi app displayed nonsense readings again. Another factory reset and reconfiguration of chargers, harvis, and hub and the app worked again (at least for displaying data though it has been flakey for switching between charging modes lately).\nMyEnergi App now working fine, with plentiful solar running the house, charging a car, and topping up the batteries. Finally I configured the Powerwalls to understand time of use tariffs, and ensured that the Zappi chargers were switched to Eco+ mode (to consume any excess solar) with a boost window that matches the cheap time of use. The result is that the Powerwall batteries charge with excess solar below 1.4kW while above that any connected cars take precedence. At night time cars and batteries can charge cheaply if they need to.\nA Learning Curve This all takes a bit of getting used to, and is definitely not plug and play. To get the most out of the system I\u0026rsquo;m finding that I have to pay close attention. If I see the battery about to saturate from solar, I plug in a car if I can. If we have consecutive grey days, I might allow overnight charging from the grid, unless tomorrow might be sunny then I take a punt.\nI think this will be easier in winter when there is very little solar generation to manage, but I\u0026rsquo;m moving towards the general rule that, in summer, the batteries should not charge from the grid, and cars should only be plugged in at night or when there has been quite a lot of solar.\nPowerwalls are depleted after my own mismanagement and a succession of grey summer days. I find I also have to watch out for grid consumption by the Powerwall units. If given permission, my Powerwalls definitely overcharge themselves when power is cheap overnight leaving little room for solar gain on the next fine summer day. This might be OK if there is capacity in a car battery, but often the cars have charged themselves overnight too! This means I either divert to hot water via an immersion heater (meaning I don\u0026rsquo;t burn any gas) or to the grid (which is public spirited but reduces economic efficiency for me). It\u0026rsquo;d be nice if Tesla could automate this better using predicted solar gain based on historical generation and usage.\nWith respect to the to Intelligent Octopus Go, it is pretty good in principle, but in practice I\u0026rsquo;ve found I like it best as a \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo; time-of-day tariff with all the smart things happening within my control. The smart aspect where it will turn on a car charger when the unit price of electricity drops is actually bad for me. Why? Because when the charger is activated during peak hours because of cheap grid prices, in my setup the power comes from the Powerwalls which know nothing about that cheap spot pricing. Instead they do what they think is the right thing and try to prevent grid use by discharging the required load (up to 10kW isn\u0026rsquo;t a problem for two units). The likely outcome is that the Powerwalls become depleted by a fast car charge and once the cheap unit price ends, I then have to pay peak tariff from the grid.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next? Part of me thinks that I\u0026rsquo;d just like to delegate all of my equipment to Octopus so they can manage it in return for cheap power at point of use. Maybe that will happen as domestic renewables become better at integrating rather than just relying on current clamps! Or the other way if I could just have predictability from grid pricing, then I can do smart things on my side.\nIn the absence of richer integrations, my next steps are to learn better how to get the best out of this system as the seasons change. I expect it to behave much more predictably when solar generation is low (as it is in winter).\nWe\u0026rsquo;re not yet fully electrified at home, though the move to smart meters has prompted me to look more into the large amount of energy we consume at home for heating and hot water. When I get chance I\u0026rsquo;ll write up some of the steps we\u0026rsquo;ve taken to use reduce demand and partially fulfill it through on-site renewables. Hopefully it\u0026rsquo;ll be less than a the four year gap it took between this piece and the previous!\nUpdate (2024-09-01) A couple of things have happened since I oringally wrote this post. One is that I left my Powerwalls alone for over two weeks while I went on holiday. I switched it to run the house solely on solar (no grid imports), and apart from that I let it be. Having returned from holiday, something clever has happened whereby the Powerwalls are now much better at predicting how much off-peak electricity they should import over night, seemingly based on how much power they think might be generated by the solar panels. This isn\u0026rsquo;t 100% accurate, but it is a lot better than me having to think about it.\nThe other is an error/omission of my own. I mentioned that under the Octopus energy scheme, one of my Zappi chargers would potentially switch on during a period of cheap grid electrcity and discharge my home batteries into my car (since the home batteries don\u0026rsquo;t know any better and dutifully discharge when asked). I latterly found out this can be disabled, in the Octopus app as you can see here:\nConfiguring the Octopus app to be less smart. In practice now my EV chargers will charge the cars only when there is excess solar (not so much as we head into Autumn) or overnight when the cost of grid power is cheap.\n","date":1720373470,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1725219721,"objectID":"d454e73ba212ca1f6e333c7b697b1b69","permalink":"https://jimwebber.org/post/2024-07-powerwall/","publishdate":"2024-07-07T18:31:10+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/2024-07-powerwall/","section":"post","summary":"Things learned installing Tesla Powerwalls and smart meters and tariffs with existing Zappi home EV chargers and two electric vehicles.","tags":["Octopus","Powerwall","Tesla","zappi","EV"],"title":"Towards Complete Domestic Electrification","type":"post"},{"authors":["Yingming Wang","Paul Ezhilchelvan","Jack Waudby","Jim Webber"],"categories":["Transactions","Concurrency Control","Database Management Systems"],"content":"","date":1718323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718323200,"objectID":"55178318338c5cb4d342927f1815cf1a","permalink":"https://jimwebber.org/publication/2024-epew/","publishdate":"2024-06-14T01:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2024-epew/","section":"publication","summary":" In this paper, we describe No-Wait concurrency control mechanisms to address conflict resolution and then comprehensively evaluate their performance under Read-Committed and Serializability isolation levels using an in-memory database system in various configurations and contention scenarios.

We were able to confirm that the optimized versions lived up to their performance claims over plain B+Trees when benchmarked in isolation. However, we also found that incorporating them into a real DBMS yields marginal improvements only. This is partly because Neo4j is not index-heavy, typically only using indexes to find starting points for graph traversals. The other part is that integrating optimized indexes into the transactions and page-based storage components of Neo4j incurs a performance penalty (for reasons of crash-tolerance) compared to the standalone implementations.

Temporal analytics allow users to query and compute over the graph throughout its history so that valuable line-of-business data is always accessible and never lost. However, existing approaches tend to be ad-hoc and vary in performance depending on the size of the effective graph workload, such as local pattern matching or global graph algorithms. In this work, we describe Aion, a transactional temporal graph DBMS that generalizes previous approaches for LPGs. Aion extends Neo4j, a modern graph DBMS, incurring minimal performance overhead by decoupling the graph’s history from the latest graph version. To support efficient temporal analytics independently of workload characteristics, Aion adopts a hybrid temporal storage approach: (i) for fast full graph restoration at arbitrary time points, it uses TimeStore that indexes updates by time; (ii) for fine-grained graph history accesses, it uses LineageStore that indexes updates by entity identifiers. To enable incremental graph computations for improved latency, Aion introduces a computeefficient in-memory LPG representation. Our experiments show that Aion achieves comparable or better performance versus existing non-transactional temporal systems and provides up to an order of magnitude speedup over classic Neo4j","tags":[],"title":"Aion: Efficient Temporal Graph Data Management","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"5b8611717b3ec7cb7fcbb2842ea6d449","permalink":"https://jimwebber.org/reviewing/2024-seagraph/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/reviewing/2024-seagraph/","section":"reviewing","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"SEAGRAPH: Search, Exploration, and Analysis in Heterogeneous Datastores - Graph Edition","type":"reviewing"},{"authors":["Paul Ezhilchelvan","Isi Mitrani","Jim Webber"],"categories":["Databases","Concurrency Control","Weak Isolation"],"content":"","date":1691366400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691366400,"objectID":"a88ae65506281d95bd50865985fd6201","permalink":"https://jimwebber.org/publication/2023-qest/","publishdate":"2023-09-20T01:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-qest/","section":"publication","summary":"A policy that reduces communication overheads by commit- ting together all transactions completed within an interval of time is examined.

Implementing serializable transaction processing efficiently is challenging. One approach, serialization graph testing (SGT) faithfully implements the conflict graph theorem by aborting only those transactions that would actually violate serializability (introduce a cycle), thus maintaining the required acyclic invariant. Alternative approaches, such as two-phase locking, disallow certain valid schedules to increase throughput, whereas SGT has the theoretically optimal property of accepting all and only conflict serializable schedules. Historically, SGT was deemed unviable in practice due to the high computational costs of maintaining an acyclic graph. Research has however overturned this historical view by utilising the increased computational power available due to modern hardware. Furthermore, a survey of 24 databases suggests that not all transactions demand conflict serializability but different transactions can perfectly settle for different, weaker isolation levels which typically require relatively lower overheads. Thus, in such a mixed environment, providing only the isolation level required of each transaction should, in theory, increase throughput and reduce aborts. The aim of this paper is to extend SGT for mixed environments subject to Adya’s mixing-correct theorem and demonstrate the resulting performance improvement. We augment the YCSB benchmark to generate transactions with different isolation requirements. For certain workloads, mixed serialization graph testing can achieve up to a 28% increase in throughput and a 19% decrease in aborts over SGT.","tags":[],"title":"Pick \u0026 Mix Isolation Levels: Mixed Serialization Graph Testing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jesùs Barrasa","Amy E.

It worked fine, and since the 2015 i3 has a small battery (~20kWh) full charges took just a few short hours. Wonderfully boring and predictable.\nFast forward to present day and the ChargeMaster socket repeatedly overheats and cuts out leaving me with potentially not enough charge for the day (ok, so there\u0026rsquo;s the range extender but that defeats the point). After a few calls to genuinely lovely people at BP ChargeMaster, we\u0026rsquo;re not getting anywhere fast. The warranty has expired and I never did talk to anyone - nice as they were - that I\u0026rsquo;d trust to wire a plug. But if I hand over another £500 I can get a replacement at some point.\n£500 for a socket - even a special, high-current, safety-concious socket is a lot of cash. So let\u0026rsquo;s look around first.\nMy first port of call was the Rolec sockets. Since this is a straight swap of like for like, it looked like a winner. It\u0026rsquo;s a few quid cheaper than the ChargeMaster kit too. Only problem is that electrical regulations have tightened up since my original socket was installed. The 18th edition regs require additional earthing to protect from the terrifying possibility of PEN faults on TN-C-S supplies. Installing an earth rod is a big undertaking, so what to do?\nEarth rods are not strictly required for indoor use (on the basis that you\u0026rsquo;re unlikely to sever the earth), but I\u0026rsquo;m conservative around mains electricity.\nAs it happens there is a more expensive but far better value EV charging socket available - the MyEnergi Zappi - which does not require an earth rod and has clever circuitry to detect PEN faults. It\u0026rsquo;s a couple of hundred quid more at ~£700 plus another few quid for associated smart gadgets. But this is easily made up for by the simple install and being 18th edition compliant without the cost and (surprising) complexity of correctly installing an earth rod.\nHaving received the Zappi, Harvi and Hub the installation was easy enough. In the Consumer Unit (\u0026ldquo;fuse box\u0026rdquo;), the existing 32A Type C MCB had to be replaced with a 32A B-curve MCB. This circuit on my CU happens to be RCD protected, but that\u0026rsquo;s not critical since the Zappi has RCD protection on the AC and DC circuits (18th edition regs again). My wiring was already present and suitable from the previous installation, 40A rated, wall-pinned and visually in excellent condition. It only needed 30-40cm of 10mm twin and earth from the existing junction box through the conduit and into the Zappi.\nZappi unit looks nice enough, for a garage anyway. I recently bought a ferrule set and crimper after seeing one in use on a video by Artisan Electrics which really made the 10mm cable connections feel very robust. I would recommend this since they\u0026rsquo;re cheap to buy and easy to use.\nSo far so good - the electrical work is very easy and because the charger has clever electronics, it\u0026rsquo;s just like wiring a regular domestic socket.\nOne of the nice things about the Zappi is that it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;smart.\u0026rdquo; It can try to use on-site generation to charge your EV when there\u0026rsquo;s excess power. And even if there\u0026rsquo;s a heavy load on your main supply (I live in the UK, so single-phase supplies are very common for houses), it\u0026rsquo;ll adjust its power delivery so that the house as a whole never draws more the mains rating (100A for me).\nLooks like I should plug the car in. Zappi senses its electrical environment using current transformer (CT) clamps. Remembering A-level physics, the current passing along a conductor can induce a current in a nearby coil proportionally to the current flowing in the main conductor which can be (safely) measured. Zappi comes with a CT clamp and I used the Harvi which provides a wireless bridge from the CT clamp to the Zappi instead of running the cable across the ceiling of my garage.\nI hadn\u0026rsquo;t read the instructions well enough and there were two problems here:\nYou have to tell Zappi that its internal CT1 is set to NONE. Then you have to nagivate to the Harvi device and set its CT1 to GRID. Ok, so took me a little while to fathom that, but got there. The bigger downside is that when using Harvi to wirelessly monitor the grid line, the maximum permissible mains current is 65A, which is 35A less than my mains rating (and indeed could supply a whole other charger). It\u0026rsquo;s not a problem for now, but adding a second EV and Zappi in the future could lead to slower and less predictable charging rates. My solution to this will be to hardwire the grid CT clamp to the Zappi by running cable round the garage. I\u0026rsquo;ll then use a second CT clamp plus the Harvi (bought and paid for, so I have to put it to use) to monitor solar output. Solar monitoring is just a nerd thing so that I can see generation on the app: the Zappi does not use the solar CT clamp in its control algorithm.\nAll of this comes together in a nice app if you use the Hub, so you can see real-time use and program EV charging without having to be at the Zappi.\nHub sitting in a rat\u0026rsquo;s nest of wires with Google wifi. Don\u0026rsquo;t judge me. I\u0026rsquo;m very impressed so far. Sure there were a couple of little gotchas while I learned my way around the menus, but otherwise a straightforward experience. Funelling excess solar into the car automatically is super nice, and the unit looks smart and is safe. The setup can also handle a static battery installation (with more CT clamps) and can prioritise whether EV or static battery storage gets excess solar power and it can also minimise using the battery to charge the car (which is very sensible).\n","date":1600678847,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600678847,"objectID":"967b4cf225ad9dcb6a484f1d24d4e132","permalink":"https://jimwebber.org/post/2020-09-zappi-installation/","publishdate":"2020-09-21T10:00:47+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-09-zappi-installation/","section":"post","summary":"Things learned installing a Zappi home EV charging socket.","tags":["zappi","EV"],"title":"Zappi Installation","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve just upgraded to the new modular Hugo static site builder and have taken the opportunity to smarten up a few things on my site.
