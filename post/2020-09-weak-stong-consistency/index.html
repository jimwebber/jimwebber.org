      <h2 id="the-old-days-eventually-consistent-graph-databases">The old days: eventually-consistent graph databases</h2>
<p>I remember some years ago when the now abandoned TitanDB was launched thinking that its design was problematic. The driver for TitanDB, its successor in JanusGraph, and other similar graph databses was scale. I think it was a rational decision: the market was eager for scalability, and prized functionality like performance or latency far less. Of course this  was - and still is - lazy thinking. Scale does not necessarily mean performant or high throughput, and often adds latency. Scale simply means you can add more computers to a system and hope to get some speedup for some use-cases.</p>
<p>But a particularly worrisome aspect about such eventually-consistent graph databases was their lack of safety. Eventual consistency is a straightforward guarantee that a replica set will converge to the same value eventually (perhaps even before the next read in good systems). The valued converged upon is influenced by the chosen concurrency control mechanisms (e.g. Last Writer Wins versus Logical Clocks etc), but nonetheless the guarantee is strictly for <em>one replica set/shard</em>. For what it&rsquo;s worth, this is usually fine for many kinds of data, but it is not fine for graphs.</p>
<h2 id="sources-of-corruption-in-eventually-consistent-graph-databases">Sources of corruption in eventually-consistent graph databases</h2>
<p>With an eventually consistent distributed graph database there are two primary sources of potential corruption:</p>
<ol>
<li>The current transaction happens to read from a replica which is stale and uses that stale data to for updates. This is more complex than the same situation in a KV, document, or column store because graph database queries touch arbitrary keys and so undoing logical corruption is impractical and typically impossible. However, this is solvable with approaches like quorum reads though they will slow down the operation of the database considerably.</li>
<li>Two transactions contend on a single relationship/egde which happens to span replica sets (shards from here on) and are applied in a mutually inconsistent order. This is also solvable but requires some functionality to impose ordering, which is expensive completely undermines eventual consistency, and so nobody does this because it implies transactions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The TitanDB team were 
<a href="http://s3.thinkaurelius.com/docs/titan/1.0.0/eventual-consistency.html#_data_inconsistency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rigorous enough to call out this problem</a>, but the language they used downplays its signficance. The documentation uses phrases like &ldquo;temporary inconsistency&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;corruption that might be repaired, but might also cause further irreperable corruption&rdquo; and &ldquo;half edges&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;corrupted edge records&rdquo;. While I don&rsquo;t think this mollifying language has directly lead to a slew of copycat databases, it certainly set a tone for ignoring safety (which is still followed by JanusGraph, TitanDB&rsquo;s fork and successor).</p>
<h2 id="quantifying-corruption-in-no-fault-systems">Quantifying corruption in no-fault systems</h2>
<p>Unsatisfied with the unsafe status quo and ill-equipped to describe these problems to the broader market, I embarked upon some work with 
<a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/people/profile/paulezhilchelvan.html#background" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Ezhilchelvan</a> and 
<a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/people/profile/isimitrani.html#background" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Isi Mitrani</a> at 
<a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newcastle University</a> where we 
<a href="http://localhost:1313/publication/2020-qmsm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modelled a transactional workload on an abstract eventually-consistent distributed graph database</a>.</p>
<p>Our abstract model treats a graph database as a collection of replica sets each holding some fraction of the overall graph. Often the relationships (edges) between the nodes (vertices) are wholly held within a single shard, but around 30% of the time relationships join nodes across shards (based on my colleague 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-firth-11265711/?originalSubdomain=uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugo Firth</a>&rsquo;s experience 
<a href="https://dblp.org/pid/147/5256.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designing partitioning algorithms</a>).</p>
<p>Our abstract model allowed for write-after-stale-read from a replica as one source of corruption, and also allowed mutually out of order update processing for relationship records that span shards as the other primary source of corruption. Out of order updates have a chance of being overwritten correctly before they&rsquo;re ever seen, but they also have a chance of the stale side of the relationship being read and used to compute future incorrect updates from where it becomes impossible to repair the data in the general case.</p>
<p>In our model, relationship records which cross shards are physically implemented as a two reciprocal records on each shard (a common real-world implementation strategy). That is if shard A has a node representing Rosa with an outgoing <code>FOLLOWS</code> relationship to a node representing Karl on shard B, then the Karl node on shard B should have an incoming <code>FOLLOWS</code> from Rosa on shard A.</p>

<p>Equally any properties on that relationship must be identical whether the relationship is traversed head to tail or tail to head.</p>
<p>// TODO: picture needed</p>
<p>We term this reciprocal consistency and it is an invariant on the database so that data can be safely stored. Any deviation from a reciprocally consistent state is corruption, and that corruption has a chance to spread through the graph.</p>
<p>Using the model, we showed that for a billions-node scale-free graph and ~10,000 TPS and with some conservative estimates for the likelihood of transactions being applied mutually out of order, that the system would be garbage (defined as 10% corruption) in around 12-18 months.</p>
<p>Since the model was computationally expensive (many hours of compute time needed for each minor parameter change) we used it to calibrate a computationally cheap numerical approximation which you can parameterise to see how your eventually consistent graph database might behave in production.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll reiterate that: <em>without any hardware or software failures, your data will be irreversibly garbage within its production lifetime.</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a shocking result for a class of technology that has a degree of market buy-in.</p>
<h2 id="when-is-strongly-consistent-not-strongly-consistent-when-its-not-consistently-strong">When is strongly consistent not strongly consistent? When it&rsquo;s not consistently strong.</h2>
<p>Other entrants to the graph database market must have also seen the risks of eventual consistency for graphs have and opted to build their offerings atop strongly consistent models to avoid these pitfalls. The approach that I&rsquo;ve seen in two databases (one closed source, one open) is to build strong guarantees into the replica sets (shards) that store the data. This is a very good starting point and is used in their marketing materials to give a sense of safety. Words like &ldquo;ACID&rdquo; and &ldquo;strongly consistent&rdquo; are used frequently to convey the safety properties of the systems.</p>
<p>But all is not well here. In fact, despite having better guarantees for consistency within a single replica set than eventually consistent databases, the same global ordering problem haunts these newer databases. Let&rsquo;s assume that we have a database made from a number shards, and that each shard is magically completely fault tolerant and converges instantaneously for any update. These are obviously impossible characteristics, but it won&rsquo;t change the outcome, I promise.</p>
<p>The problem is again of reciprocal consistency being undermined by race conditions in the presence of concurrent contented transactions. While we have fewer opportunities to read stale data in a single shard (because we assumed instant convergence), it&rsquo;s still possible that transactions will be delivered mutually out of order to a pair of shards causing corruption which will then be read and used to propagate more corrupt writes around the graph.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s play this out. Consider two transactions <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> which both update a common cross-shard relationship <code>R</code> in some mutally incompatible manner. Drawing on the TitanDB example, this could be where one transaction tries to delete <code>R</code> while the other tries to update it.</p>
<p>There are two ways these transactions can achieve a consistent outcome and two ways in which they won&rsquo;t, and since we don&rsquo;t have any coordination logic to impose an ordering (presumably on the basis that it inhibits scalability) then we have to rely on natural arrival order and prayer.</p>
